HOW TO USE BLUETOOTH FUNCTION:

ON PI SIDE:
 - first thing to do is run this command in healthsystem directory:
	+ sudo ./bluetoothshell.sh
 - this shell is for:
	+ turning discovery mode for bluetooth on
	+ run bluetooth server code 
 - after running that command, pi will begin to wait for connection from android app

ON ANDROID APP SIDE:
 - after opening app, open bluetooth function
 - choose pi in paired devices list
 - after choosing paired device, pi will notify a connection was accepted
 - now 2 buttons on android app will send string to pi everytime they are pushed:
	+ connect button will send a default string to pi and pi will print the string on screen
	+ disconnect button will send "disconnected" string to pi to terminate the connection 
between 2 devices and pi will also print the string on screen
